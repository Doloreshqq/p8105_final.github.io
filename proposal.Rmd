## **Project Title**

Depression Factors Prediction based on DASS Responses

## **Group Members**

Huanyu Chen (hc3451), Qin Huang (qh2284), Ou Sha (os2424), Lehan Zou(lz2950), Shaolei Ma (sm5592)

## **Motivation**

Observing that mental health issues appear at a younger and younger age, we would like to test if DASS can potentially provide a means to objectively evaluate the severity and the potential factors of depression among different population including races, ages, etc.

## **Final Products**

We currently plan to deliver a website containing the following parts: data overview (data source, data cleaning), exploratory data analysis, model building, as well as a user-interactive R Shiny dashboard.

## **Data Sources**

Our group applied the dataset from Kaggle Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales Responses (link attached below) for this project. The DASS-42 is a self-report scale consisting of 42 items intended to gauge emotional states related to depression, anxiety, and stress. The primary benefit of utilizing the DASS in a clinical context is its ability to ascertain the specific location of emotional turmoil, contributing to a more comprehensive clinical assessment. Its core function is to evaluate the severity of the fundamental symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, and stress.

##  **The Planned Analysis, Visualizations, and Coding Challenges**

First, we would like to filter, check validity, and eliminate incompetent data; then, we would score each person\'s depression levels. Our group plans to use box plots and/or scatter plots to show the distributions among different variables. We would apply chi-squared test to compare the distribution of different factors within depression levels. Based on the levels, we would also apply regression models to figure out the possible factors, including age, sex, location, etc, leading to depression. Understanding survey questions, as well as cleaning and tidying the dataset into a readable format is one of our current coding challenges.
