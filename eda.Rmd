# Shiny app

The data we used to analyze potential factors of depression levels comes from a worldwide survey. 
The raw data includes 9 potential factors:`country`, `education`, `urban`, `gender`, `religion`, 
`orientation`, `race`, `married`, and `age`. We would like to focus on `country`, `orientation`, `gender`, `age`, and `race` to analyze the relationship between these factors and depression level. 
This [shiny app](https://doloreshqq.shinyapps.io/r_shiny_for_p8105/) 
provides visualizations of depression levels for individual countries on a global scale. A screenshot is shown below:

# Plots
With our existence data, we need to evaluate the depression level with respect to different populations. After some preliminary research and plotting, we identified a potential correlation between four variables including `gender`, `orientation`, `age` ,`race` and our predictor Depression Level. Subsequently, we proceeded with following exploratory data analysis to identify pertinent variables that could function as independent variables in our regression model.

## Depression Level vs. Orientation vs. Gender

First, we would like to observe the distribution of depression levels according to orientation and gender.
The plot below shows the number of different depression level cases in each gender groups among orientation. 

```{r}
dass_new|>
  group_by(gender, orientation)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
          Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
          Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
          Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
          Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"),
          .groups = "keep")|>
  pivot_longer(
    Normal:Extremely_Severe,
    names_to = "Level",
    values_to = "count")|>
  mutate(Level = factor(Level, levels = unique(Level)))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = Level, y = count, fill= gender)) +
  geom_col()+
  theme_minimal()+
  facet_grid(~orientation)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Depression level", 
       y = "count of cases", 
       title = "Depression level vs. orientation vs. gender")
```

From the plot, we observed that the female gender group in all orientation categories tends to exhibit a higher number of depression cases compared to other gender groups.


## Depression level vs. Orientation

Next, we would like to delve deeper into studying the relationship between the level of depression and orientation.

```{r}
dass_new|>
  group_by(orientation)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))|>
  pivot_longer(
    Normal:Extremely_Severe,
    names_to = "Level",
    values_to = "Count")|>
  mutate(Level = factor(Level, levels = unique(Level)))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = Level, y = Count, group = orientation, color = orientation)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Depression level", 
       y = "count of cases", 
       title = "Depression level vs. orientation groups")
```



## Depression level vs. Gender

```{r}
# distribution histogram of gender
dass_new|>
  group_by(gender)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))|>
  pivot_longer(
    Normal:Extremely_Severe,
    names_to = "Level",
    values_to = "Count")|>
  mutate(Level = factor(Level, levels = unique(Level)))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = Level, y = Count, group = gender, color = gender)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Depression level", 
       y = "count of cases", 
       title = "Depression level vs. gender groups")
```


## Depression Level vs. Race groups

```{r}
dass_new|>
  # form new race groups
  mutate(race = case_when(race == "Native American" ~ "Other",
                          race=="Arab"~ "Other", 
                          race == "Indigenous Australian" ~ "Other",
                          race == "Other" ~ "Other",
                          race == "Black" ~ "Black",
                          race == "White" ~ "White",
                          race == "Asian" ~ "Asian"))|>
  group_by(race)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))|>
  pivot_longer(
    Normal:Extremely_Severe,
    names_to = "Level",
    values_to = "Count")|>

  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Depression level", 
       y = "count of cases", 
       title = "Depression level vs. race groups")
```

## Age Distribution for Each Depression Level
```{r}
dass_new %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=depression_level, y=age)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=depression_level)) +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution for Each Depression Level",
        xlab = "Depression Level",
        ylab = "Age")+
  theme_minimal()

```

## Depression Level vs. Age groups

```{r}
dass_new|>
  # form age groups
  mutate(age = case_when(age <= 18 ~ "teenage", 
                         age <= 25 & age >18 ~ "young adult",
                         age <= 50 & age >25 ~ "adult", 
                         age >50 ~ "older"))|>
  group_by(age)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),

# Chi-squared Test

From the plots above, we observed that the distribution of cases of different depression levels among different orientation groups, the distribution of cases of different depression levels among different gender groups, the distribution of cases of different depression levels among different age groups, and the distribution of cases of different depression levels among different race groups follow a similar pattern. Thus, we would like to perform a chi-squared test to study if these factors and depression levels are associated.\

## 1: Orientation & Depression Level

$H_0$: The depression levels and orientation are independent.\
$H_1$: The depression levels and orientation are associated.

```{r}
# show result table to perform chi-squared test
dass_new|>
  group_by(orientation)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))
# perform chi-squared test
chisq.test(pull(dass_new, orientation), pull(dass_new, depression_level))|>
  broom::tidy()|>
  knitr::kable()
```

The null hypothesis for the chi-squared test is that the depression levels and orientation are independent. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. \
We may conclude that orientation is associated with depression levels.


## 2: Gender & Depression Level

$H_0$: The depression levels and gender are independent.\
$H_1$: The depression levels and gender are associated.

```{r}
# show result table to perform chi-squared test
dass_new|>
  group_by(gender)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))
# perform chi-squared test
chisq.test(pull(dass_new, gender), pull(dass_new, depression_level))|>
  broom::tidy()|>
  knitr::kable()
```

The null hypothesis for the chi-squared test is that the depression levels and gender are independent. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. \
We may conclude that gender is associated with depression levels.


## 3: Age & Depression Level

$H_0$: The depression levels and age are independent.\
$H_1$: The depression levels and age are associated.

```{r}
dass_chi <- dass_new|>
  # form age groups
  mutate(age = case_when(age <= 18 ~ "teenage", 
                         age <= 25 & age >18 ~ "young adult",
                         age <= 50 & age >25 ~ "adult", 
                         age >50 ~ "older"))
# show result table to perform chi-squared test
dass_chi|>
  group_by(age)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))
# perform chi-squared test
chisq.test(pull(dass_chi, age), pull(dass_chi, depression_level))|>
  broom::tidy()|>
  knitr::kable()
```

The null hypothesis for the chi-squared test is that depression levels and age are independent. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.\
We may conclude that age is associated with depression levels.

## 4: Race & Depression Level

$H_0$: The depression levels and race groups are independent.\
$H_1$: The depression levels and race groups are associated.

```{r}
dass_chi <- dass_new|>
  # form new race groups
  mutate(race = case_when(race == "Native American" ~ "Other",
                          race=="Arab"~ "Other", 
                          race == "Indigenous Australian" ~ "Other",
                          race == "Other" ~ "Other",
                          race == "Black" ~ "Black",
                          race == "White" ~ "White",
                          race == "Asian" ~ "Asian"))
# show result table to perform chi-squared test
dass_chi|>
  group_by(race)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))
# perform chi-squared test
chisq.test(pull(dass_chi, race), pull(dass_chi, depression_level))|>
  broom::tidy()|>
  knitr::kable()
```

The null hypothesis for the chi-squared test is that depression levels and race groups are independent. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. \
We may conclude that race is associated with depression levels.

Based on the performed tests, orientation, gender, age, and race are strongly associated with depression levels.
