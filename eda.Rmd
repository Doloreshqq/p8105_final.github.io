# Shiny app

The data we used to analyze potential factors of depression levels comes from a worldwide survey. 
The raw data includes 9 potential factors:`country`, `education`, `urban`, `gender`, `religion`, 
`orientation`, `race`, `married`, and `age`. We would like to focus on `country`, `orientation`, `gender`, `age`, and `race` to analyze the relationship between these factors and depression level. 
This [shiny app](https://doloreshqq.shinyapps.io/r_shiny_for_p8105/) 
provides visualizations of depression levels for individual countries on a global scale. A screenshot is shown below:

# Plots
With our existence data, we need to evaluate the depression level with respect to different populations. After some preliminary research and plotting, we identified a potential correlation between four variables including `gender`, `orientation`, `age` ,`race` and our predictor Depression Level. Subsequently, we proceeded with following exploratory data analysis to identify pertinent variables that could function as independent variables in our regression model.

## Depression Level vs. Orientation vs. Gender

Our first plot gives an overall view of the relationship with gender, orientation and depression level. 

The plot below shows the number of different depression level cases in each gender groups among orientation. 

```{r}
dass_new|>
  group_by(gender, orientation)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
          Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
          Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
          Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
          Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"),
          .groups = "keep")|>
  pivot_longer(
    Normal:Extremely_Severe,
    names_to = "Level",
    values_to = "count")|>
  mutate(Level = factor(Level, levels = unique(Level)))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = Level, y = count, fill= gender)) +
  geom_col()+
  theme_minimal()+
  facet_grid(~orientation)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Depression level", 
       y = "count of cases", 
       title = "Depression level vs. orientation vs. gender")
```

The x axis illustrates depression levels categorized by various orientations, while the y axis denotes the count of cases. Additionally, the bar plot's proportional filling conveys the gender distribution within a particular depression level under each orientation. From the plot, we observed that the female gender group in all orientation categories tends to exhibit a higher number of depression cases compared to other gender groups. Also, we found that depression level has significant differences between distinct orientation groups and genders. So we would like to further investigate the correlation between depression levels and each factor individually. 


## Depression level vs. Orientation

Next, we would like to delve deeper into studying the relationship between the level of depression and orientation.

```{r}
dass_new|>
  group_by(orientation)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))|>
  pivot_longer(
    Normal:Extremely_Severe,
    names_to = "Level",
    values_to = "Count")|>
  mutate(Level = factor(Level, levels = unique(Level)))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = Level, y = Count, group = orientation, color = orientation)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Depression level", 
       y = "count of cases", 
       title = "Depression level vs. orientation groups")
```

This plot shows the relationship between depression levels and orientations. Given that heterosexual data is the most abundant, it naturally exhibits the highest case count. However, our primary emphasis in this analysis is on discerning the overarching trends across various depression levels.Notably, we observe fluctuations in individuals identifying as Heterosexual across depression levels, while there is a conspicuous rise in count among Bisexual individuals as the severity of depression increases. Asexual and Homosexual individuals display a relatively even distribution across all levels. The "Other" category exhibits a low count for "Mild" but experiences an increase with severity, peaking at the "Extremely Severe" level.


## Depression level vs. Gender

```{r}
# distribution histogram of gender
dass_new|>
  group_by(gender)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))|>
  pivot_longer(
    Normal:Extremely_Severe,
    names_to = "Level",
    values_to = "Count")|>
  mutate(Level = factor(Level, levels = unique(Level)))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = Level, y = Count, group = gender, color = gender)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Depression level", 
       y = "count of cases", 
       title = "Depression level vs. gender groups")
```
In our third plot, it becomes evident that females consistently exhibit a notably higher count of depression cases across all levels, especially in the "Normal" and "Extremely Severe" levels. Conversely, males display a lower case count at all levels, with a slight decrease at "Mild" followed by an increase at "Moderate." The case count for the "Other" gender category remains relatively stable across all levels of depression.

## Depression Level vs. Race groups

```{r}
dass_new|>
  # form new race groups
  mutate(race = case_when(race == "Native American" ~ "Other",
                          race=="Arab"~ "Other", 
                          race == "Indigenous Australian" ~ "Other",
                          race == "Other" ~ "Other",
                          race == "Black" ~ "Black",
                          race == "White" ~ "White",
                          race == "Asian" ~ "Asian"))|>
  group_by(race)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))|>
  pivot_longer(
    Normal:Extremely_Severe,
    names_to = "Level",
    values_to = "Count")|>
  mutate(Level = factor(Level, levels = unique(Level)))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = Level, y = Count, group = race, color = race)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Depression level", 
       y = "count of cases", 
       title = "Depression level vs. race groups")
```

The fourth plot examines depression levels across various races. The Asian group demonstrates the most fluctuating trend, with notable values at "Normal" and "Extremely Severe." The White group and other racial categories exhibit similar trends, showing a slight decrease at "Mild" and a substantial increase at "Extremely Severe." In contrast, Black individuals maintain a consistent count across all levels of depression.
 
## Age Distribution for Each Depression Level

```{r}
dass_new %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=depression_level, y=age)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=depression_level)) +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution for Each Depression Level",
        xlab = "Depression Level",
        ylab = "Age")+
  theme_minimal()

```

Regarding the age variable, we examined the box plot representing the general distribution of age and depression level. Our observation revealed the presence of numerous outliers. Across all depression levels, the data predominantly centered on the teenage age groups around 18~25. Thus we divided age into four groups(under 18, 18 ~ 25, 25 ~ 50 and 50+) in next step.

## Depression Level vs. Age groups

```{r}
dass_new|>
  # form age groups
  mutate(age = case_when(age <= 18 ~ "teenage", 
                         age <= 25 & age >18 ~ "young adult",
                         age <= 50 & age >25 ~ "adult", 
                         age >50 ~ "older"))|>
  group_by(age)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))|>
  pivot_longer(
    Normal:Extremely_Severe,
    names_to = "Level",
    values_to = "Count")|>
  mutate(Level = factor(Level, levels = unique(Level)))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = Level, y = Count, group = age, color = age)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Depression level", 
       y = "count of cases", 
       title = "Depression level vs. age groups")
```


# Chi-squared Test

From the plots above, we observed that the distribution of cases of different depression levels among different orientation groups, the distribution of cases of different depression levels among different gender groups, the distribution of cases of different depression levels among different age groups, and the distribution of cases of different depression levels among different race groups follow a similar pattern. Thus, we would like to perform a chi-squared test to study if these factors and depression levels are associated.\

## 1: Orientation & Depression Level

$H_0$: The depression levels and orientation are independent.\
$H_1$: The depression levels and orientation are associated.

```{r}
# show result table to perform chi-squared test
dass_new|>
  group_by(orientation)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))
# perform chi-squared test
chisq.test(pull(dass_new, orientation), pull(dass_new, depression_level))|>
  broom::tidy()|>
  knitr::kable()
```

The null hypothesis for the chi-squared test is that the depression levels and orientation are independent. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. \
We may conclude that orientation is associated with depression levels.


## 2: Gender & Depression Level

$H_0$: The depression levels and gender are independent.\
$H_1$: The depression levels and gender are associated.

```{r}
# show result table to perform chi-squared test
dass_new|>
  group_by(gender)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))
# perform chi-squared test
chisq.test(pull(dass_new, gender), pull(dass_new, depression_level))|>
  broom::tidy()|>
  knitr::kable()
```

The null hypothesis for the chi-squared test is that the depression levels and gender are independent. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. \
We may conclude that gender is associated with depression levels.


## 3: Age & Depression Level

$H_0$: The depression levels and age are independent.\
$H_1$: The depression levels and age are associated.

```{r}
dass_chi <- dass_new|>
  # form age groups
  mutate(age = case_when(age <= 18 ~ "teenage", 
                         age <= 25 & age >18 ~ "young adult",
                         age <= 50 & age >25 ~ "adult", 
                         age >50 ~ "older"))
# show result table to perform chi-squared test
dass_chi|>
  group_by(age)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))
# perform chi-squared test
chisq.test(pull(dass_chi, age), pull(dass_chi, depression_level))|>
  broom::tidy()|>
  knitr::kable()
```

The null hypothesis for the chi-squared test is that depression levels and age are independent. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.\
We may conclude that age is associated with depression levels.

## 4: Race & Depression Level

$H_0$: The depression levels and race groups are independent.\
$H_1$: The depression levels and race groups are associated.

```{r}
dass_chi <- dass_new|>
  # form new race groups
  mutate(race = case_when(race == "Native American" ~ "Other",
                          race=="Arab"~ "Other", 
                          race == "Indigenous Australian" ~ "Other",
                          race == "Other" ~ "Other",
                          race == "Black" ~ "Black",
                          race == "White" ~ "White",
                          race == "Asian" ~ "Asian"))
# show result table to perform chi-squared test
dass_chi|>
  group_by(race)|>
  summarise(Normal = sum(depression_level=="Normal"),
            Mild = sum(depression_level=="Mild"),
            Moderate = sum(depression_level=="Moderate"),
            Severe = sum(depression_level=="Severe"),
            Extremely_Severe = sum(depression_level=="Extremely severe"))
# perform chi-squared test
chisq.test(pull(dass_chi, race), pull(dass_chi, depression_level))|>
  broom::tidy()|>
  knitr::kable()
```

The null hypothesis for the chi-squared test is that depression levels and race groups are independent. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. \
We may conclude that race is associated with depression levels.

Based on the performed tests, orientation, gender, age, and race are strongly associated with depression levels.
