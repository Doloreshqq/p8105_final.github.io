```

The goal is to fit an ordered logit model.

## Independent Variables

First, test the distribution of independent variables.
```{r}
dass_new = read_csv("data/dass_new.csv")

dass_new |> 
  dplyr::select(age, everything()) |> 
  mutate(across(country:depression_level, factor)) |> 
  summary()
```

Some categories contain few samples. For the efficacy of the model, we regroup the independent variables following the standards below:

 * `country`: Group the country with less than 500 samples into "Other", and set "US" to be the reference level.
 * `education`: Order the variable by the length of education.
 * `race`: We follow [standards on race and ethnicity](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1997-10-30/pdf/97-28653.pdf) to include only "Asian", "Black", "Native American", "White", and make other categories "Other". We set "White" to be the reference level. 
 * `religion`: We conclude "Christian (Catholic)", "Christian (Mormon)", "Christian (Other)", "Christian (Protestant)" into "Christian", and set it as the reference level.
 * `orientation`: Set the "Heterosexual" to be the reference level.
 * `married`: Order the variable by marriage status.

```{r}
dass_fit_df =
  dass_new |> 
  mutate(
    country = relevel(as.factor(ifelse(country %in% c("MY", "US", "GB", "CA", "ID", "PH"), country, "Other")), ref = "US"),
    education = factor(education, levels = c("Less than high school", "High school", "University degree", "Graduate degree")),
    race = relevel(as.factor(ifelse(race %in% c("Arab", "Indigenous Australian"), "Other", race)), ref = "White"),
    religion = relevel(as.factor(ifelse(substr(religion, 1, 9) == "Christian", "Christian", religion)), "Christian"),
    orientation = relevel(as.factor(orientation), "Heterosexual"),
    married = factor(married, levels = c("Never married", "Currently married", "Previously married")),
    depression_level = factor(depression_level, levels = c("Normal", "Mild", "Moderate", "Severe", "Extremely severe"))
  )

dass_fit_df |> summary()
```

## Model Fitting

First fit a model without variables selection.
```{r}
dass_fit = 
  dass_fit_df |> 
  polr(depression_level ~ ., data = _)

(fit_s = 
  dass_fit |> 
  summary())
```

Test the parallel assumption.
```{r}
car::poTest(dass_fit)
```

Because the overall $p value < 0.001$, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the parallel assumption is not met.

To meet the parallel assumption, we try the following two methods:

 * **Select independent variables**: Because we think `religion` and `race`, `married` and `orientation`, `country` and `urban` are strongly correlated with each other, and we care more about `race`, `orientation`, and `country`, first delete `religion`, `married`, and `urban`. We also delete `education` to meet the parallel assumption.
 * **Regroup dependent variable**: Regroup `depression_level` into "Moderate or Below", "Severe", "Extremely severe".

```{r}
dass_fit_df =
  dass_fit_df |> 
  mutate(depression_level = factor(case_match(
    depression_level,
    "Normal" ~ "Moderate or Below",
    "Mild" ~ "Moderate or Below","Moderate" ~ "Moderate or Below",
    "Severe" ~ "Severe",
    "Extremely severe" ~ "Extremely severe"
   ), level = c("Moderate or Below", "Severe", "Extremely severe")))

dass_fit1 =
  dass_fit_df |> 
  polr(depression_level ~ country + gender + age + orientation + race, data = _)

dass_fit1 |> poTest()
```

The model meets the parallel assumption at $\alpha=0.05$ level (with an overall $p = 0.067 > 0.05$).

```{r}
dass_fit1 |> summary()
```

The estimated model can be written as:
$$logit(\hat P(Depression\: Level\leq Severe))=-0.69+0.18*I(country=CA)+0.20*I(country=GB)\\-0.04*I(country=ID)-0.19*I(country=MY)+0.13*I(country=PH)+0.11*I(country=Other)\\-0.10*I(gender=Male)+0.38*I(gender=Other)-0.03*age+0.23*I(orientation=Asexual)\\+0.40*I(orientation=Bisexual)+0.30*I(orientation=Homosexual)+0.22*I(orientation=Other)\\-0.16*I(race=Asian)-0.09*I(race=Black)+0.11*I(race=Native\:American)-0.10*I(race=Other)$$

$$logit(\hat P(Depression\: Level\leq Extremely\:Severe))=0.01+0.18*I(country=CA)+0.20*I(country=GB)\\-0.04*I(country=ID)-0.19*I(country=MY)+0.13*I(country=PH)+0.11*I(country=Other)\\-0.10*I(gender=Male)+0.38*I(gender=Other)-0.03*age+0.23*I(orientation=Asexual)\\+0.40*I(orientation=Bisexual)+0.30*I(orientation=Homosexual)+0.22*I(orientation=Other)\\-0.16*I(race=Asian)-0.09*I(race=Black)+0.11*I(race=Native\:American)-0.10*I(race=Other)$$

## Interpretation
Calculate the odds ratio and CI for variables:
```{r}
exp(cbind(OR = coef(dass_fit1), confint(dass_fit1))) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

**Country**:

 * For Canadian, Britain, and Philippines participants, the odds of having a more severe depression level is higher than that of US participants, holding constant all other variables.
 * For Indonesia and Malaysia participants, the odds of having a more severe depression level is lower than that of US participants, holding constant all other variables.
 
**Gender**:

 * For male participants, the odds of having a more severe depression level is 0.90 times that of female participants, holding constant all other variables.
 * For non-binary participants, the odds of having a more severe depression level is 1.47 times that of female participants, holding constant all other variables.
 
**Age**:

 * For every one unit increase in participant's age, the odds of having a more severe depression level is multiplied 0.98 times, holding constant all other variables. It indicates that older people may have less risk to get depressed.
 
**Orientation**:

 * For sexual minorities, the odds of having a more severe depression level is higher than that of heterosexual orientation participants, holding constant all other variables.
 
**Race**:

 * For Native American participants, the odds of having a more severe depression level is higher than that of White participants, holding constant all other variables.
 * For Asian, Black, and Other participants, the odds of having a more severe depression level is lower than that of White participants, holding constant all other variables.

## Graphs Based On Current Regression Models
```{r}
library(pROC)

# Predicting probabilities for all classes
predicted_probs <- predict(dass_fit1, type = "probs")

# Extracting the response variable
response <- ifelse(dass_fit_df$depression_level == "Moderate or Below", 1,
                   ifelse(dass_fit_df$depression_level == "Severe", 2, 3))

# Calculating ROC curve for Severe (class 2)
roc_obj <- roc(as.numeric(response == 1), predicted_probs[, "Moderate or Below"])

# Plotting ROC curve
plot(roc_obj, col = "blue", main = "ROC Curve for Severe Depression Level")
```

```{r}
# Extract coefficients for countries
pos_country = str_starts(names(dass_fit1$coefficients), "country")

country_coefficients <- data.frame(
  country = substr(names(dass_fit1$coefficients)[pos_country], 8, 20),
  coefficient = dass_fit1$coefficients[pos_country]
)

# Plotting coefficients for countries
ggplot(country_coefficients, aes(x = country, y = coefficient)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Effect of Countries on Depression Levels", x = "Country", y = "Coefficient")
```


```{r, fig.width=22, fig.height=53, message = FALSE}
library(effects)

# Create a data frame with the predictor values for visualization
predictor_data <- model.matrix(depression_level ~ country + gender + age + orientation + race, data = dass_fit_df)

# Compute the effects
effects <- allEffects(dass_fit1, xlevels = list(predictor_data))

# Plot the effects
plot(effects, style = "stacked")
```

## Limitations

 * Imbalance within samples (e.g. 76.3% female samples).
 * Strong dependence between independent variables (e.g. race versus religion).
 * Counterintuitive results (e.g. Asian people have lower risk of getting severely depressed than white people).
 * Future Improvements:
    * Clustering to decrease dependence;
    * Fit a separate model for each depression level to avoid parallel assumption.
